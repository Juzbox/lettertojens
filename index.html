<p>Dear Jens,</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to meet you today and discover through your words, what letter writing means to you.</p> 

<p>In response, I would like to share with you what creative coding has come to mean to me. This may or 
may not explicitly transpire in my upcoming project, however I hope to seed in this letter inklings 
I can come back to later.</p> 

<p>We are here on a platform called Github. I have found it intimidating for the longest time. To this 
day, like most of the softwares I use, I can only wrap my head around a small portion of its functionalities. 
That being said, it is a place of beauty. The uses for it are many: archive, diary, website hosting. 
I have here uploaded micro-sites to summarize past projects, but also parametric poems in the
form of lines of code, mostly java and javascript. I have also copy and pasted others' code, sifted 
through creative experiments by strangers, and often felt welcomed and cared for, when discovering
a concsientiously crafted walk-through on how to replicate another programmer's creation.</p>

<p>Even the name of the most common commands offered by the interface are poetic in their brutal
essentialism: push, pull, fork, commit.</p>

<p>This letter is now public. Hidden in plain sight. It is fully meant for you, and yet, will also exist
here, a small ode to the platform, and perhaps a peculiar sight to the occasional gleaner or the curious 
soul coming across it. Once written it will have been *pushed* to you, you will *pull* it by reading it, 
and perhaps you, or someone else, may decide to *fork* it were you or they to replicate this epistolary format, 
or screenshot it, or fix its typos, or create a video game staging the reading of this very text. Regardless 
of what comes of it, I will have *committed* to sharing these words.</p>

<p>Creative coding, usually implies the use of code to produce audiovisual or otherwise sensorial experiences.
And that is the reason I got into it: creating interactive digital works. However, along the way, I have 
discovered a world of carefulness, pedagogical affinity, and exploratory essence that I have yet to find
elsewhere. And that I seek in the works of practitioners I admire like Taeyoon Choi, Jose Sanchez, or Free Art 
and Technology (FAT).</p>

<p>All seem to care for the holding environment, the conditions under which they, and others are invited to 
practice. Making sure its bounds are known but negotiable, legible even if challenging, and thus in doing so, 
intrinsically social.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hugo</p>
